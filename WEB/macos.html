                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah)</h2>
                    <p>Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah) March 24, 2001: Aqua interface is born with Mac OS X Cheetah. It’s a big step in the evolution of graphical interfaces, with 2D and 3D graphics support, granting an all-new visual experience. Cheetah featured
                        a water theme, which, according to Steve Jobs, "one wanted to lick when they saw it." Beauty comes at a cost, though. Graphics improvements made Cheetah very slow, which prompted Apple to shift focus from visual experience to performance
                        in the next release.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 25, 2001: As you might have noticed, the first generation of Apple’s operating systems was named after animals. Puma arrived with a solid performance boost and a few other functional improvements such as simplified CD and DVD burning, new features
                        in Finder, and more extensive printer support.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar)</h2>
                    <p>
                        August 23, 2002: The third release of Mac OS X added search to Finder (can you imagine it, Finder used to exist without it!) Jaguar also brings MPEG-4 support for QuickTime, a range of privacy features, and, for the first time, Accessibility API called
                        Universal Access. Some of the apps born with this release continue living on Mac even today (for example, Address Book, which is now called Contacts).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther)</h2>
                    <p>October 24, 2003: Meet Safari! The first official web browser made by Apple replaces Internet Explorer on Mac. In fact, Safari was available on Jaguar but it’s the first release where it becomes a default browser. Other than that,
                        Panther adds 150+ new features, including Font Book, Xcode enhancements, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</h2>
                    <p>
                        April 29, 2005: Did you think Apple TV is pretty new? Well, guess what, it was born in 2005, with the release of Apple’s fifth operating system! Tiger was a pretty big update. It featured Spotlight search, Automator, VoiceOver, and around 200 other improvements.
                        During this time, Apple also switched to Intel’s processors, which made Tiger the first system operating on Macs with Intel chips.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)</h2>
                    <p>
                        October 26, 2007: Here comes Leopard, one of the most Mac-changing systems. This time, Mac’s desktop changes significantly, with Dock, a new menu bar, and Stacks. Time Machine, Spotlight enhancements, and support for 64-bit apps arrive too. In fact, Leopard
                        featured so much new stuff that Apple even had to delay the initial release date to finish it all in time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)</h2>
                    <p>
                        August 28, 2009: Leopard’s successor, Snow Leopard, focused on expanding 64-bit architecture. Most of the native applications were rewritten in 64-bit. Back then, experts used to say that was the first step to a full transition, which, as we know today,
                        became true. Also, the App Store was born in the Snow Leopard era.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)</h2>
                    <p>
                        July 20, 2011: With Lion, Apple brings lots of useful enhancements from iOS to Mac OS. Launchpad, multi-touch gestures, and more. Interestingly, many people criticized Mac OS X 10.7 for the so-called "natural scrolling," which moved the content up when
                        you scroll down. Back then, it seemed more natural to have the content move down — as Windows did it.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)</h2>
                    <p>
                        July 25, 2012: Major apps like Notes, Reminders, and Messages arrive from iOS, turning Mac into a more comfortable spot for managing your daily routine. The most significant update in Mountain Lion is Notification Center, with on-screen banners communicating
                        updates.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)</h2>
                    <p>
                        October 22, 2013: Operating system number 10 debuts a range of privacy features, majorly focused on password encryption and storage. This is when iCloud Keychain arrives. Also, OS X 10.9 features new Maps, iBooks, and Tags for the first time, as well
                        as upgrades Notification Center by allowing users to reply directly from notifications.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)</h2>
                    <p>
                        October 16, 2014: Biggest redesign in years. From small things like thin fonts and new color schemes to the big shift towards flat graphic design, which better matches the design of iOS. What’s more, Yosemite introduces Handoff and Continuity. This once
                        again confirms Apple’s intention to craft a better cross-device experience in the future.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 30, 2015: El Capitan is faster, better, stronger than the previous operating system, due to a major performance boost. For example, it allows opening apps 40% faster than old systems. Also, this is the year when Split View’s dual-pane emerges,
                        opening up new possibilities for managing windows on Mac.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 10.12 (Sierra)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 20, 2016: With Sierra, Apple shifts to the "macOS" naming. Again, more iOS perks arrive, such as unlocking a Mac with Apple Watch. There’s also a new Storage Optimization feature with a detailed overview of storage and suggestions on how to
                        free up disk space. And, hey Siri!
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 10.13 (High Sierra)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 25, 2017: macOS High Sierra adds a new video standard called HEIC and a transition to Apple File System (APFS), which is an improved alternative to its predecessor file system HFS+. Apart from that, there are a few enhancements in Safari, Mail,
                        and Photo — but nothing major.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 10.14 (Mojave)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 24, 2018: That’s when things go dark. We mean Dark Mode! Mac users can now move through their day-and-night routine, with the colors of the screen moving with them, thanks to Dynamic Desktop feature. There are more and more apps that arrive
                        from iOS, including Stocks, News, and Home.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 10.15 (Catalina)</h2>
                    <p>
                        October 7, 2019: macOS Catalina marks the death of iTunes, splitting Apple’s top-destination for media content into three dedicated apps — Music, Podcasts, and Movies. Apple continues aligning iOS and macOS with Sidecar, a feature that lets your connect
                        an iPad screen to your Mac, and the ability for developers to port iOS apps to macOS.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 11 (Big Sur)</h2>
                    <p>
                        November 19, 2020: There’s no macOS 10.16, because Big Sur deserves a more epic version name — 11.0. Bringing a huge design change and transition to Apple’s M1 Macs, macOS Big Sur is the one to remember. This is the first operating system that allows
                        running iOS apps natively on Mac — the so-called Universal apps.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 12 (Monterey)</h2>
                    <p>
                        October 25, 2021: macOS Monterey brings Shortcuts — the ability to set up quick actions with different apps to automate your flow. Apart from that, there’s Universal Control, a natural transitioning across your Mac and iOS devices (for example, you can
                        move your cursor between Mac and iPad); redesigned Safari with tab groups, and a range of cool FaceTime enhancements. More on macOS 12 Monterey here.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 13 (Ventura) </h2>
                    <p>
                        October 25, 2022: macOS Ventura arrives with a major interface change, the feature called Stage Manager. While it’s opt-in, many users will make Stage Manager a default because it’s a great way to transition between tasks and workspaces. Essentially,
                        Stage Manager automatically organizes active windows into stacks, placed on the left side of the screen. Other Ventura goodies? Continuity Camera, Undo Send in Mail, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 14 (Sonoma)</h2>
                    <p>
                        September 26, 2023: macOS Sonoma offers a handful of important improvements over macOS 13 Ventura and earlier versions. With Sonoma, you can add and interact with widgets on your desktop, treat websites like standalone apps, create multi-user profiles
                        in the Safari browser, enjoy a completely redesigned presenter view in video calls, add reaction effects to your meetings with intuitive gestures, enjoy all-new games, and much more. Read more about macOS Sonoma best features.
                    </p>
                    <h2>macOS 15 (Sequoia)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fall, 2024: Apple Intelligence is here for the first time! New Writing Tools help you polish your text, and Image Playground and Genmoji help you create images. Siri better understands mumbles and gives contextual answers. Another new feature is iPhone
                        Mirroring, which lets you control iPhone from your Mac, even when your phone is locked. Plus, there's a new cross-platform Passwords app.

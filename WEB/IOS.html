                        <h2>iPhone OS 1</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iPhone OS 1 at the iPhone keynote on January 9, 2007, and it was released to the public alongside the first-generation iPhone on June 29, 2007.[3] No official name was given when the iPhone was released, and Steve Jobs just said "iPhone
                            runs OS X".[4][5] During the development phase of iPhone OS 1, "probably 16, 17 different concepts" were developed. Many on the team were skeptical of the feasibility of a touchscreen keyboard, and believed that users would
                            prefer hardware keyboards. A number of different user interfaces were prototyped, including one that involved a multi-touch click-wheel.[6] iPhone OS 1 was criticized for its lack of support for Adobe Flash web content, copy
                            and paste, and Bluetooth stereo headphones.[7] It also lacked support for third-party native apps, and only supported web apps,[8] which was criticized by reviewers and developers,[9][10] including John Carmack.[11] iPhone
                            OS 1.1 was the first version supported by the first generation iPod Touch.[12] iPhone OS 1.1.4 is the final version of iPhone OS 1 for the first generation iPhone, with iPhone OS 1.1.5 being the final version of iPhone OS 1
                            available for the first generation iPod Touch.[13] It was succeeded by iPhone OS 2 on July 11, 2008.[14]
                        </p>
                        <h2>iPhone OS 2</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iPhone OS 2 at a March 6 keynote,[16][17] and it was released to the public on July 11, 2008, alongside the iPhone 3G.[14] iPhone OS 2 was the first release to have the App Store and to come with an official iPhone SDK allowing third-party
                            developers to create native iPhone apps.[18][19] It also added many enterprise features, including Microsoft Exchange support through ActiveSync for push emails, push contact and push calendars, and support for IPsec VPNs.[17]
                            Apple did not drop support for any of its devices with the release; iPhone OS 2 was compatible with all devices released up to that time.[14] The release of iPhone OS 2.1.1 brought support for the second generation iPod Touch.[20]
                            iPhone OS 2.2.1 is the final version of iPhone OS 2. It was succeeded by iPhone OS 3 on June 17, 2009.[21]
                        </p>
                        <h2>iPhone OS 3</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iPhone OS 3 on March 17, 2009,[23] and it was released to the public on June 17, 2009, alongside the iPhone 3GS. Apple did not drop support for any devices with this release. iPhone OS 3 was compatible with all devices released up to that
                            time, but not all features were available on the original iPhone.[21] The final release supported on the original iPhone and iPod Touch (1st generation) is iPhone OS 3.1.3.[24] The first iPad was introduced along with iPhone
                            OS 3.2.[25][26] iPhone OS 3 was succeeded by iOS 4 on June 21, 2010.[27] iPhone OS 3 was the first version to support cut, copy and paste.[28] The feature had previously only been available through jailbreaking.[29]
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 4</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 4 in April 2010,[30] and released it to the public on June 21, 2010, alongside the iPhone 4.[27] It was the first version of the operating system to be called "iOS", due to the iPad being released. With this release, Apple dropped
                            support for the original iPhone and the first generation iPod Touch, which is the first time Apple had dropped support for any device in an iOS release.[27] The iPhone 3G and the second generation iPod Touch were capable of
                            running iOS 4, but had more limited features. For example, both devices lacked multitasking,[31] and the ability to set a custom home screen wallpaper.[32] This was also the first major release to be free of charge for iPod
                            Touch users.[27] The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original iPad[33] and was the final release supported on the iPhone 3G and 2nd generation iPod Touch due to significant performance issues. The release
                            of iOS 4.3 added support for the iPad 2.[34] It was succeeded by iOS 5 on October 12, 2011.[35]
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 5</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 5 on June 6, 2011, at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event,[35] and it was released to the public on October 12, 2011, alongside the iPhone 4S. With this release, Apple did not drop support for these devices,[36]
                            though support for the iPhone 3G and the iPod Touch (2nd generation) had already been dropped with iOS 4.3 seven months earlier due to hardware limitations and performance issues.[34] The release of iOS 5.1 brought support
                            for the iPad (3rd generation).[37] iOS 5.1.1 was the final release supported for the iPad (1st generation) and iPod Touch (3rd generation).[38][39] iOS 5.0 was also the last iOS version announced while Steve Jobs was alive.[40]
                            It was succeeded by iOS 6 on September 19, 2012.[41]
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 6</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 6 on June 11, 2012, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 19, 2012, alongside the iPhone 5, iPod Touch (5th generation), and iPad (4th generation). With this
                            release, Apple dropped support for the iPod Touch (3rd generation) and the iPad (1st generation) due to performance issues, and offered only limited support on the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch (4th generation).[42] The iPhone
                            4 onwards, the iPod Touch (5th generation), the iPad 2 onwards, and the iPad Mini (1st generation) were fully supported.[43] iOS 6.1.6 was the final release supported for the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch (4th generation). It was
                            succeeded by iOS 7 on September 18, 2013.
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 7</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 7 on June 10, 2013, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 18, 2013, alongside the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. With this release, Apple dropped support for the
                            iPhone 3GS due to hardware limitations and the iPod Touch (4th generation) due to performance issues. iOS 7 has limited support on the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4 since they do not support Siri. However, other devices from the
                            iPhone 4S onwards, iPod Touch (5th generation) onwards, the iPad (3rd generation) onwards, and the iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 7.0.3 brought support for the iPad Air and iPad
                            Mini 2. iOS 7.1.2 was the final release on the iPhone 4. iOS 7 is the first iOS version to support 64-bit processors. It is also the first iOS version to run 64-bit apps. It was succeeded by iOS 8 on June 2, 2014.
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 8</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 8 on June 2, 2014, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 17, 2014, alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. With this release, Apple dropped support for the
                            iPhone 4 due to performance issues, and the Apple TV (2nd generation) due to hardware limitations. iOS 8 has limited support on the iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), and the iPod Touch (5th
                            generation),[citation needed] as Apple received widespread complaints of extremely poor performance from owners of these devices. All other devices from the iPhone 5 onwards, iPod Touch (6th generation) onwards, the iPad (4th
                            generation) onwards, and the iPad Mini 2 onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 8.1 brought support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3, and the release of iOS 8.4 brought support for the iPod Touch (6th generation).
                            iOS 8.3 was the first version of iOS to have public beta testing available, where users could test the beta for upcoming releases of iOS and send feedback to Apple about bugs and issues. The final version of iOS 8 was iOS 8.4.1.
                            iOS 8 was succeeded by iOS 9 on June 8, 2015.
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 9</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 9 on June 8, 2015, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 16, 2015, alongside the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus and iPad Mini 4. With this release, Apple did not
                            drop support for any iOS devices, but support for Apple TV (3rd generation) has been dropped following the release due to 32-bit deprecations. Therefore, iOS 9 was supported on the iPhone 4S onwards, iPod Touch (5th generation)
                            onwards, the iPad 2 onwards, and the iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards. However, iOS 9 has limited support on devices with an Apple A5 or A5X processor: the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation),
                            and iPod Touch (5th generation).[citation needed] This release made the iPad 2 the first device to support six major releases of iOS, supporting iOS 4 through iOS 9. Despite Apple's promise of better performance on these devices,
                            there were still widespread complaints that the issue had not been fixed. iOS 9.3.5 is the final release on the iPod Touch (5th generation), the Wi-Fi-only iPad 2, the Wi-Fi-only iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi-only iPad
                            Mini (1st generation). iOS 9.3.6 is the final release on the iPhone 4S, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad 2, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad Mini (1st generation). iOS 9 is the last version
                            to run on iPhones and iPads with 30-pin connector. iOS 9 was succeeded by iOS 10 on September 10, 2016.
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 10</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 10 on June 13, 2016, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 13, 2016, alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. With this release, Apple dropped support for
                            devices using an A5 or A5X processor: the iPhone 4S, the iPad 2, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Mini (1st generation), and iPod Touch (5th generation) due to hardware limitations and performance issues, ending software support
                            for iPhones and iPads with 30-pin connector and 3.5-inch display. iOS 10 has limited support on devices with 32-bit processors: the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPad (4th generation).[citation needed] However, the iPhone 5S onwards,
                            iPod Touch (6th generation), iPad Air onwards, and the iPad Mini 2 onwards are fully supported. The release of iOS 10.2.1 brought support for the iPad (5th generation), and iOS 10.3.2 brought support for the iPad Pro (10.5-inch)
                            and the iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2nd generation). iOS 10.3.3 is the final supported release for the iPhone 5C and the Wi-Fi—only iPad (4th generation), while iOS 10.3.4 is the final supported release for the iPhone 5 and the iPad
                            (4th generation) with cellular modem. iOS 10 is the final iOS version to run on 32-bit processors, including non–Touch ID iPhones. It is also the final version of iOS to run 32-bit apps. It was succeeded by iOS 11 on September
                            19, 2017.
                        </p>
                        <h2>iOS 11</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apple announced iOS 11 on June 5, 2017, at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event, and it was released to the public on September 19, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. With this release, Apple dropped support for the

                            support for any iOS devices. Therefore, iOS 12 was supported on the iPhone 5S onwards, iPod Touch (6th generation), the iPad Air onwards and the iPad Mini 2 onwards. However, iOS 12 has limited support on devices with the Apple
                            A7 or A8 processors: the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPod Touch (6th generation), iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 2, 3 and 4.[citation needed] All other devices from the iPhone 6S onwards, the iPad Air (2019), the iPad (5th generation)

                            like the iPhone 6. Several areas that were focused on were the keyboard, made to appear up to 50% faster; app launch times, improved to be up to 40% faster; and the action to slide up to take a photo, made up to 70% faster.[47]
                            However, several new features were also introduced with the update, such as Memoji, a feature that allows users to create "personalized emojis",[48] a new Screen Time feature to track device usage,[49] improvements to Siri,
                            Apple's virtual assistant,[50] and Apple's book reading application, Apple Books (previously named iBooks), was given a significant redesign.[51]
